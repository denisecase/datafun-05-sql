# datafun-05-sql

This project partially completes the requirements for [datafun-05-spec](https://github.com/denisecase/datafun-05-spec).

## Python Standard Library

The project uses these packages from the Python Standard Library:

- pathlib - to work with folders and files
- sqlite3 - to work with a Sqlite file-based database

If you want to avoid using a project virtual environment, it is possible to use the csv module from the Python Standard Library to read csv files. 

## External Packages & Project Virtual Environment

To work with csv files using a bit cleaner code, we choose to use pandas, an external library, not part of the Python Standard Library. 
Therefore, this project requires a project virtual environment, which we recommend creating in the .venv folder.
